Source code documentation tool for \*(ST

.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.
\fBtedoc\fP is a tool for extracting documentation from \*(ST macros
and C/C++ code.
It is used to document \*(ST's internal commands as well as macro
packages.
.SCITECO_TOPIC .TEDOC
It processes special \*(ST comment blocks from the \fIsources\fP,
generating \fBtroff\fP man-page markup and inserts them into
a man-page \fItemplate\fP at the position of the \fBTEDOC\fP
pseudo-request.
The result is written to an \fIoutput\fP file.
\fBtedoc\fP can thus be understood as a \fBtroff\fP preprocessor.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.IP "\fB-C\fP"
Instruct \fBtedoc\fP to extract C/C++ comments instead of
\*(ST comments.
The C comments begin with \(lq/*$\(rq and end with \(lq*/\(rq.
The \*(ST comments in contrast begin with \(lq!*$\(rq and end
with \(lq*!\(rq.
.IP "\fIoutput\fP"
The resulting man-page file.
.IP "\fItemplate\fP"
A man-page template, i.e. a man-page with the \fBTEDOC\fP
request.
.IP "\fIsources...\fP"
An arbitrary number of source code files to scan through.
The comments are extracted in document order, i.e. from the
first comment in the first source file to the last comment
in the last source file specified.
.
.
.SH TEDOC COMMENTS
.\" FIXME: !*$ cannot be indexed since it terminates the
.\" header comment in *.woman.tec files.
.SCITECO_TOPIC "/*$"
.
The \fBtedoc\fP source code comments support a small but powerful
semantic markup for documenting \*(ST commands and macros:
.IP \(bu 4
Comments start with \(lq!*$\(rq (or \(lq/*$\(rq in C/C++ mode).
.IP \(bu
The first line (immediately after the starting comment) may
contain \fItopic\fP keywords for \*(ST's online help system that
will point to the beginning of the section generated for this
\fBtedoc\fP comment.
This generates \fBSCITECO_TOPIC\fP macro calls defined
in \fBsciteco.tmac\fP (see \fBgrosciteco.tes\fP(1).
.IP \(bu
All lines until first empty line are syntax descriptions.
.IP \(bu
Text followed by \(lq--\(rq is a short description.
.IP \(bu
Variable values and characters of syntactic significance should be
detected automatically.
.IP \(bu
Alternatives are denoted by \(lq|\(rq.
.IP \(bu
Every line is an alternative (e.g. different calling forms of the
same command or macro).
.IP \(bu
Return values may be specified after \(lq->\(rq.
.IP \(bu
The remaining text is the verbose command description.
.RS
.  IP \(bu
\(lq<name>\(rq denotes a variable from the syntax description.
.  IP \(bu
Empty lines introduce paragraphs.
.  IP \(bu
Lines beginning with \(lq-\(rq are unordered lists.
.  IP \(bu
Lines beginning with numbers and dot (\(lq1.\(rq, \(lq2.\(rq, etc.) are
ordered lists.
.  IP \(bu
These transformations are only preprocessing, so that
\fBtroff\fP requests, macros and escapes may also be used freely.
