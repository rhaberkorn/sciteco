GNU roff post-processor for \*(ST

.OP "--"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.
\fBgrosciteco\fP is a post-processor for \fBGNU roff\fP which works
similar to \fBgroff\fP's \fBgrotty\fP post-processor and driver.
Similarily, \fBgrosciteco\fP is a plain-text formatter \(em but
since it lays out the document itself and is written in the \*(ST
language, it will generate an additional \*(ST macro that can be
executed to style the plain-text document.
.LP
.SCITECO_TOPIC woman women womanpage
The plain-text document will usually have the extension \(lqwoman\(rq
and the accompanying \*(ST macro will have the extension \(lqwoman.tec\(rq.
Both files combined are called \fIwomanpage\fP since they are commonly
\*(ST-formatted man pages.
.LP
Furthermore, \fIwomanpages\fP can be indexed by search terms
(called topics).
A per-file topic index is generated as part of the \(lqwoman.tec\(rq
output file.
Users of \fBgrosciteco\fP can define topics in \fBtroff\fP
markup using the \fBSCITECO_TOPIC\fP troff macro defined
in the \(lqsciteco.tmac\(rq macro package.
This macro package should always be loaded when processing
\fBtroff\fP documents which are going to be post-processed by
\fBgrosciteco\fP.
.LP
Preparing a \fIwomanpage\fP for display is usually performed
automatically by \*(ST's \(lqwoman.tes\(rq lexer definition
whenever you open a \(lq*.woman\(rq file in \*(ST.
\fIwomanpages\fP are recommended to be installed into a special
directory in \*(ST's standard library.
The \*(ST command \fB?\fP provides an online help feature
which gives fast access to properly-installed \fIwomanpages\fP.
It builds a global topic index of all \fIwomanpages\fP installed
in the \fB$SCITECOPATH/women\fP directory.
\fBgrosciteco\fP is thus a central component in providing
\*(ST's help system, in documenting internal commands, the
\*(ST standard library macros and third-party macro packages.
The generation of \fIwomanpages\fP at compile-time means
that no \fBtroff\fP is required by end users to browse
documentation within \*(ST.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.IP "\fB-t \fItec_output\fR"
The \*(ST script that when executed after loading
\fItext_output\fP into a Scintilla view, styles that document.
It can be thought of as representing meta-information
for \fItext_output\fP.
In order to cooperate with the \(lqwoman\(rq lexer and
\*(ST's \fB?\fP command, its file name should be
\fItext_output\fP.tec, e.g. \(lqgreat-macro.woman.tec\(rq.
This is also the default when omitted.
.IP "\fItext_output\fP
The plain-text output file, e.g. \(lqgreat-macro.woman\(rq.
.IP "\fIinput\fP"
The \fIinput\fP file is in \fBtroff\fP's device-independant
output format.
.
.
.SH SPECIAL TROFF MACROS
.
.SCITECO_TOPIC sciteco.tmac tmac
\fBtroff\fP documents should be processed with the
\(lqsciteco.tmac\(rq macro package that also ships with
\*(ST.
It tweaks formatting for display in \*(ST (assuming
that the lexer system for \fIwomanpages\fP is in place)
and provides the following \fBtroff\fP macros that
can be called by documentation authors:
.
.TP
\fB.SCITECO_TOPIC \fItopics...\fR
.SCITECO_TOPIC .SCITECO_TOPIC SCITECO_TOPIC
Defines one or more topics in \*(ST's help system.
Every topic must be in its own macro argument.
A \fItopic\fP can be looked up in \*(ST using
the \fB?\fItopic\fB$\fR command, but in case of
topic collisions, \*(ST will modify the topic name
to keep it unique.
The \fB?\fP (question mark) command will jump to the position
that corresponds to the macro call in \fBtroff\fP
markup.
Topics can and should only consist of printable characters,
so escape characters should be written in their up-caret
notation (e.g. \(lq^[\(rq instead of escape).
\*(ST expands control characters to their printabel form
when looking up terms.
.TQ
\fB.SCITECO_TT\fP [\fIline length\fP]
.SCITECO_TOPIC .SCITECO_TT SCITECO_TT
Marks the beginning of an area that must be formatted
in a monospaced font.
\fBgrosciteco\fP has only limited support for Troff font styles
and the font family used depends on the \*(ST UI used to
show the womanpage.
Since line drawing commands assume a TTY-like output device,
.B SCITECO_TT
should precede those sections of text (including the \fBtbl\fP
macro \fBTS\fP).
An optional temporary \fIline length\fP may also be specified
which is especially useful for tables.
.TQ
\fB.SCITECO_TT_END\fP [\fBSP\fP]
.SCITECO_TOPIC .SCITECO_TT_END SCITECO_TT_END
Marks the end of an area that must be formatted in a
monospaced font.
The optional \fBSP\fP keyword may be specified to skip one
line vertically (via troff's \fB.sp\fP request).
.TQ
\fB.SCITECO_STARTSTYLING\fP
.SCITECO_TOPIC .SCITECO_STARTSTYLING SCITECO_STARTSTYLING
Marks the beginning of a block for manual Scintilla styling.
.TQ
\fB.SCITECO_SETSTYLING\fP \fIstyle\fP
.SCITECO_TOPIC .SCITECO_SETSTYLING SCITECO_SETSTYLING
Assign the given Scintilla style number to the block beginning with
.BR .SCITECO_STARTSTYLING .
This style must have been configured in a custom macro.
.
.LP
These public macros will be ignored if \(lqsciteco.tmac\(rq
is not loaded, so it is safe to use them in man pages
that are also installed into the system.
.LP
Note that \(lqsciteco.tmac\(rq is not installed into the
standard \fBGNU roff\fP macro search directories, but into
\*(ST data directory at \(lq@scitecodatadir@\(rq.
It must thus be moved or linked manually into one of the
search paths, or the data dir must be added to the search
paths.
Alternatively, you may also add it to the \fBgroff\fP
command line with the \fB-M\fP option.
.
.
.SH EXAMPLES
.
The following UNIX shell commands will generate the \fIwomanpage\fP for
a \*(ST macro package with a man page called
\fBgreat-macro.tes\fP(7sciteco):
.
.RS
.SCITECO_TT
.EX
groff -Z -Kutf-8 -Tutf8 -man -M@scitecodatadir@ -msciteco \\
      great-macro.tes.7sciteco >great-macro.tes.7sciteco.intermediate
grosciteco.tes great-macro.tes.7sciteco.woman great-macro.tes.7sciteco.intermediate
.SCITECO_TT_END
.EE
.RE
.LP
The resulting files should be installed to
.B "@scitecolibdir@/women"
(or wherever \fB$SCITECOPATH\fP points to at runtime)
to make the files accessible in \*(ST's online-help system.
.
.
.SH BUGS
.
.LP
\fBgrosciteco\fP is quite slow, although this is a \*(ST issue.
.LP
The \fBpic\fP(1) preprocessor is poorly supported and diacritics
may not be rendered properly.
