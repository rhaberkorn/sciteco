.\" grosciteco is similar to grotty, so we can
.\" inherit its definitions:
.nroff
.do mso tty.tmac

.\" Groff only supports .device as of v1.20, while
.\" much older versions are sometimes in use (especially
.\" on OS X).
.\" This is as close as I could get in reproducing it,
.\" but there are still subtle differences...

.\" Define topics at the current document position.
.\" This is handled by grosciteco to create a topic index
.\" at the top of the file which is in turn read by SciTECO
.\" to build a global help topic index.
.\"
.\" NOTE: We let Troff handle the argument processing, since
.\" parsing them in SciTECO would be tricky.

.\" grosciteco does not handle font families right now
.\" and probably will never do because of the limited
.\" number of Scintilla styles available.
.\" But even if we did, we sometimes have to enforce
.\" a fixed-width font for drawings and tables, since
.\" they can only be "typeset" with glyphs by Scintilla.
