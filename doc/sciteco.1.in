.SH DESCRIPTION
.
\*(ST is an interactive
.B TECO
dialect, similar to
.BR "Video TECO" .
It also adds features from classic
.BR "Standard TECO-11" ,
and incorporates many unique new ideas.
It is geared towards UNIX-like operating systems but also
natively supports Microsoft Windows NT\*(Tm.
.
.LP
When executed, \*(ST mungs (executes) the TECO macro stored in the file
specified by the
.B \-\-mung
option.
The munged file is executed in non-interactive
.RI ( batch )
mode, allowing the user to write stand-alone TECO scripts.
In contrast to ordinary macro execution,
if the first two characters of the file are \(lq#!\(rq its first line
is ignored.
Therefore under UNIX-like operating systems, TECO macro files may be
invoked as scripts by using a Hashbang line like
.RS
.EX
#!@bindir@/sciteco -m
.EE
.RE
If the munged macro does not request program termination using the
.I EX
command, \*(ST will automatically switch into its graphical
.I interactive
mode.
\*(ST may be built with different graphical user interfaces,
including Curses and GTK+ based ones.
.
.LP
Upon startup \*(ST's buffer ring contains only one unnamed empty buffer.
All command line arguments after the \*(ST options are passed as
.I arguments
to the munged macro by placing each argument on its own line in
the buffer.
In any case the current buffer position (called
.IR dot )
is left at the beginning of the buffer.
Optionally \(lq\-\-\(rq might be used to separate \*(ST options and
macro arguments.
.
.LP
Batch mode also has the following differences compared to interactive mode:
.RS
.IP \(bu
Messages are logged to
.I stdout
or
.I stderr
prefixed with a string signifying message severity.
.IP \(bu
Any error will terminate the program.
.IP \(bu
Character rubout is disabled.
Therefore code runs significantly faster than in interactive mode
and less care needs to be taken regarding memory clutter due to
undo token accumulation.
.RE
.
.LP
If the
.B \-\-mung
option is absent, \*(ST will mung
.I ~/.teco_ini
(if existing) which is called the profile.
The profile will usually set up various Scintilla and \*(ST options,
configure syntax highlighting,
define commonly used macros and open files specified as arguments to \*(ST.
It will usually leave the editor in interactive mode.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.IP "\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR"
Display a short help text on the console. 
.IP "\fB-e\fR, \fB--eval\fR \fImacro"
Evaluate (execute)
.I macro
specified as a command-line option.
Similar to munging but always exits afterwards.
If the option is specified, the
.B \-\-mung
option has no effect.
.IP "\fB-m\fR, \fB--mung\fR \fIfile"
Mung
.IR file .
Default is
.IR ~/.teco_ini .
.
.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.
\*(ST will return a non-null exit code if an error occurred during
batch mode processing.
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.
Before \*(ST executes any macro, all of the variables in the process
environment are inserted into the global
.I Q-Register
table.
A dollar sign is prepended before each variable name, so that for
instance the variable \(lqHOME\(rq can be examined by macros by
reading the string-content of Q-Register \(lq$HOME\(rq.
The following environment variables have a special meaning for
\*(ST:
.TP
.B SCITECOPATH
Standard library macro path.
Macros can expect to find standard library macros in this
directory.
It defaults to
.B "@DEFAULT_SCITECOPATH@"
(often the standard library path).
.
.
.SH FILES
.
.TP
.B ~/.teco_ini
Default profile macro.
.TP
.B @pkgdatadir@/teco.ini
Sample profile macro configuring commonly used run-time options
and opening files specified as arguments.
.TP
.B @scitecolibdir@/...
Standard library macros.
.
.
.SH BUGS
.
\*(ST does not have any such thing called \(lqbug\(rq.
Any conceived misbehaviour must be totally your fault.
