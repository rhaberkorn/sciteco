Overview
========

<img align="left" alt="SciTECO" src="ico/sciteco-48.png"/>
SciTECO is an interactive TECO dialect, similar to Video TECO.
It also adds features from classic TECO-11, as well as unique new ideas.

The basic approach to text editing is both radically different and surprisingly similar to popular
editors like Vi or EMacs. Instead of using mostly keyboard commands to modify text in a visual
manner, in SciTECO you edit a program (called macro) using very few keyboard commands (called
immediate editing commands). This program edits text for the user and is executed immediately,
as far as possible. For instance, moving the cursor to the right can be done immediatly via the
"C" command which is a part of the editor language. The language is the editor so to speak.
When you delete a character from the end of the command line macro (called rubout), the
side-effects of that character which may be a command or part of a command, are undone.

SciTECO uses the [Scintilla](http://www.scintilla.org/) editor component and supports
GTK+ 3 as well as Curses frontends (using [Scinterm](http://foicica.com/scinterm/)).

The Curses frontend is verified to work with [ncurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/),
[NetBSD Curses](https://github.com/sabotage-linux/netbsd-curses),
[PDCurses/XCurses](http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/), the
[PDCurses win32a port](http://www.projectpluto.com/win32a.htm) and
[EMCurses](https://github.com/rhaberkorn/emcurses).
Others might work as well.

Linux, FreeBSD, Windows (MinGW 32/64) ~~and
[Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/) (gcc4)~~ are tested and supported.
[Mac OS X is built during Continuous Integration but is otherwise untested
and packages currently cannot be provided.](https://github.com/rhaberkorn/sciteco/wiki/Mac-OS-Support)
SciTECO compiles with both GCC and Clang.
SciTECO should compile just fine on other UNIX-compatible platforms.
However UNIX-compatibility is not strictly required:
Since SciTECO primarily depends on [glib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/) and
some implementation of Curses, it should be easy to port to even more exotic platforms.

__Warning: The SciTECO language is work in progress and has not yet fully stabilized.
It may change drastically and in backwards-incompatible ways in the repository's
master branch and between releases until version 3.0 is released.__

Features
========

* Supports most of the [Video TECO](http://www.copters.com/teco.html) commands
* Improved parser compared to classic TECOs, making SciTECO
  more similar to other imperative languages.
* Operator precedence in arithmetic expressions and an argument stack that may be modified
  by the user (commands may have more than two arguments)
* Extended Q-Register namespace (arbitrary strings): Can be used to build libraries and
  can be abused as a data structure.
* Make use of your keyboard's function keys by assigning them to strings inserted into
  the command stream.
  This also enables navigating with function keys (e.g. cursor keys) as demonstrated
  by the standard library `fnkeys.tes`.
  Function key macros can be context-sensitive, too.
* Many TECO-11 features, like that most commands have a colon-modified form, string-building
  characters, exotic match characters...
* Interactivity: Immediate searching (similar to search-as-you-type) and
  context-sensitive immediate editing commands.
  In fact almost everything is done on-the-fly, giving immediate interactive feedback.
  This also means that commands can fail immediately and will not even be accepted into
  the command line, making it harder to write incorrect interactive macros.
  Context-sensitive immediate editing commands also make it much harder to destroy a day's
  work by accident than in classic TECOs.
  Also, SciTECO supports many types of context-sensitive auto-completions (ie. the Tab-key):
  Q-Register names, file names, directories, goto labels, help topics...
* Command rubout: SciTECO can undo almost every side effect, including file writes
  (`EW` command).
  This makes it even harder to destroy work by accident than in most other
  editors.
  Rubbed out commands can be re-inserted (redo).
* Munging: Macros may be munged, that is executed in batch mode. In other words, SciTECO
  can be used for scripting.
  By default, a profile is munged.
* 8-bit clean: SciTECO can be used to edit binary files if automatic EOL conversion
  is turned off (`16,0ED`).
* Self-documenting: An integrated indexed help system allows browsing formatted documentation
  about commands, macros and concepts within SciTECO (`?` command).
  Macro packages can be documented with the `tedoc` tool, generating man pages.
  Man pages and [GNU troff](https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/) markup in general
  can be compiled into documents loadable by SciTECO using the `grosciteco` post-processor.
* Cross platform: Builds on a wide variety of platforms. While being focused on UNIX
  and drawing some inspiration from it, other platforms (esp. Windows) are fully
  supported. It is made sure that SciTECO integrates well into all supported
  platforms even without an UNIX-like environment.
* SciTECO is console and command-line friendly.
  Besides running under Curses and being a scripting language, it is written
  to be used interactively on system terminals, can be integrated into
  UNIX pipelines and can be extended with external command-line tools
  (see `EC` command).
* Themeability and consistency: Color settings (or schemes) are applied consistenly
  across all supported platforms. Gtk+ builds allow further customization using CSS.
  The user interface is kept minimalistic and is consistent in spirit across the
  different platforms.
* Syntax highlighting, styles, line numbers, etc. thanks to Scintilla.
  Low-level Scintilla commands can also be accessed to extend SciTECO.
* A growing standard library of macros with frameworks for color schemes, syntax highlighting
  and buffer sessions.
  Optimized for hack-ability rather than completeness.

Download
========

There are prebuilt binary packages and source bundles for your convenience:

* [Download Archive at Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sciteco/files/)
* [Github Releases](https://github.com/rhaberkorn/sciteco/releases)
* [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~robin-haberkorn/+archive/sciteco)
* Users of OpenWrt may try to install the
  [`sciteco` package of this feed](https://github.com/rhaberkorn/nanonote-ports).
* Yocto/OpenEmbedded users should try the
  [`sciteco` package from this layer](https://github.com/rhaberkorn/meta-rhaberkorn).
* [Chocolatey package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/SciTECO)
  for Windows users.
* The official [SciTECO homepage](http://sciteco.sf.net/) is a live demo.

These releases may be quite outdated, so you may also give a try to the
[nightly Ubuntu packages](https://nightly.link/rhaberkorn/sciteco/workflows/nightly/master) -
they represent the repository's HEAD commit but may well be instable.
Both ncurses and Gtk+ packages are provided.

If everything fails, you can try building from source.
See [`INSTALL`](INSTALL) for more details.
