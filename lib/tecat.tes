 * Replace all control characters with printable representations as in SciTECO.
 * These characters are printed in reverse using ANSI escape sequences.
 * This is especially useful as a textconv filter for Git as in
 * git config --global diff.teco.textconv "sciteco -8qm /usr/local/share/sciteco/lib/tecat.tes"
 *
 * You also have to add the following to ~/.gitattributes:
 * *.teco_ini      diff=teco
 * .teco_session   diff=teco
 * *.tes           diff=teco
 * *.tec           diff=teco
