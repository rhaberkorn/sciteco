Releases, nightly builds, both as repositories and binary downloads for RPM-based distributions
(Fedora, openSUSE etc.) and Debian-based distributions (Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu) are now provided via
[Open Build Service repositories](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:rhaberkorn:sciteco):

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Releases**  | [Common](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:rhaberkorn:sciteco:STABLE&package=sciteco-common) | [Gtk](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:rhaberkorn:sciteco:STABLE&package=sciteco-gtk) | [Curses](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:rhaberkorn:sciteco:STABLE&package=sciteco-curses) |
| **Nightlies** | [Common](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:rhaberkorn:sciteco:UNSTABLE&package=sciteco-common) | [Gtk](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:rhaberkorn:sciteco:UNSTABLE&package=sciteco-gtk) | [Curses](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:rhaberkorn:sciteco:UNSTABLE&package=sciteco-curses) |

The different links are only relevant when downloading packages - there are only two different OBS repositories per distribution.
This deprecates the [Ubuntu PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~robin-haberkorn/+archive/sciteco).
FreeBSD, Windows and Mac OS binaries are still provided via [Github releases](https://github.com/rhaberkorn/sciteco/releases)
and [nightly builds](https://github.com/rhaberkorn/sciteco/releases/tag/nightly).
